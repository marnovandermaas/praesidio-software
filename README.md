# Praesidio Software

This repository contains the code for the management shim, software for linux user mode, software for bare-metal enclave mode and libraries necessary for all of these.

This code requires praesidio enabled Spike and Linux. The best way to run it is in the context of praesidio-sdk: https://github.com/marnovandermaas/praesidio-sdk.git
